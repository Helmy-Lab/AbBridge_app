# AbBridge_app
Bridging Antibodies Across Species

AbBridge is designed for antibody repurposing across species. The current version accepts UniProt IDs as input for both reference and target proteins. It provides outputs across multiple tabs, including:

Global and local pairwise alignments

3D structural alignment with RMSD

Detailed color-coded sequence alignment

Interactive 3D visualization of all provided IDs


FASTA file upload is supported, but it is still under development.

The app uses the MUSCLE algorithm for structural alignment. Make sure MUSCLE is installed and available in your system PATH.
